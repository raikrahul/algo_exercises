/*20.1-8

Suppose that instead of a linked list, each array entry Adj[u] is a
hash table containing the vertices v for which (u, v) âˆˆ E, with collisions resolved by chaining.
Under the assumption of uniform independent hashing,
if all edge lookups are equally likely,
what is the expected time to determine whether an edge is in the graph?
What disadvantages does this scheme have? Suggest an alternate data structure
for each edge list that solves these problems.
Does your alternative have disadvantages compared with the hash table?*/
