Most graph algorithms that take an adjacency-matrix representation as input require Ω(V2) time,
but there are some exceptions. Show how to determine whether a 
directed graph G contains a universal sink—a vertex with in-degree 
|V| – 1 and out-degree 0—in O(V) time, given an adjacency matrix for G.
